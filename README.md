# Air bnb Data analysis

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data to derive insights into ride patterns, customer begavior, driver performance, and operational efficiency and enhance customer experience. The analysis covers trip durations, rider behaviors, and key geographical metrics.

## Project Overview:
Uber generates a large volume of data related to rides, derivers, and customers behavior. This project aims to:

* Data Analysis: Use SQL to query and analyze key metrics related to rides, customers, and drivers.
* Visualization: Create interactive dashboards using Tableau to visualize trends and performance metrics.

## Key Objectives:
* Understanding ride distribution: Analyze the geographical and temporal distribution of Uber rides.
* Trip duration Prediction: Use data-driven methods to predict trip durations.
* Peak hours identification: Identify peak hours and locations for Uber rides.
* Optimize routes: Investigate the most efficient routes based on past ride data.
* Business insights: Provide actionable insights for Uber to improve their service.

## Dataset:
* Ride Details: Trip ID, date, time, pickup and drop-off locations, distance traveled, and fare amount.
* Customer Information: Demographics and feekback.
* Driver Information: Driver ID, ratings, total trips, and performance metrics.

## Tool used:
* SQL :- Used for querying the dataset and performing complex joins and aggregations.
* Tableau :- For building interactive visual dashboard.

## SQL Techniques:
* Joins: Perform joins between tables to combine dataset such as trips and geographical data.
* Aggregations: Calculate the average trip duration, the number of trips per hour, and peak usage times.
* Group By and Order By: Group trips by location or time and order them by relevant metrics like distance or duration.
* Subqueries: Utilize subqueries to filter data for specific locations or timeframes.
